# About

This is a really simple client for [hack-n-bill](http://github.com/grantdobbe/hack-n-bill), a Drupal server that does billing, RFID card tracking, machine authorization, consumables billing and more. This is just a bit of python that can authenticate itself and work with the RESTful API module.
